or How We Work (Together)
-------------------------

We welcome each and every contributor to scikit-image.  Our aim is
enthusiastic and productive collaboration, to build an excellent
software library, and to have a ton of fun doing it.  We encourage one
another to be gentle in criticism of others' work, humble in
acknowledging our own mistakes, and generous in our praise.

If you ever feel like you are not being treated as well as you should, please
get in touch with one of the project leads (our email addresses are available
through our GitHub profiles).  We are committed to making this community a
safe and welcome space.
